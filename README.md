Travis County Overview
Travis County population growth continues to outpace both that of Texas and the US. A recent report from the Census Bureau with 2017 population estimates extended Austin’s streak for the seventh consecutive year as the fastest-growing metropolitan area. Travis County alone has made population gains of 19.7% between 2000 to 2017, and counties
 surrounding Austin have added over 55,000 people to the area between 2016 to 2017. In
other words, the population grew nearly the same size of the entire student body of the University of Texas-Austin, ranking the Austin-Round Rock population growth of 2.7 percent among the fastest-growing in the country.
People moving to Travis County have tended to be younger, partially because of the universities and colleges that attract students to its campuses. According to the most recent net migration estimates provided by the University of Wisconsin, the largest group of people moving into the County was between the ages of 20 to29 years old. Whereas, children under the age of 9 and
aging adults were moving out of Travis County

Owning a vehicle costs Austin residents an estimated $12,481 a year, and costs slightly more in the outlying areas. A typical household will spend 20 percent of their monthly income towards transportation. It is also nearly all the income for a person living under poverty, based on the 2016 poverty threshold of $12,486.
Low-income households continue to lose ground in the central core of Austin, and are increasingly concentrated in the outlying areas of Travis County and surrounding areas. These households are then faced with increased transportation costs to get to jobs in Austin, which further strains household finances.


Transit Mobility and Equity
Transportation costs, typically a household’s second-largest expenditure after housing costs, are largely a function of the characteristics of the neighborhood in which a household lives. The population that is increasingly moving away from the areas of concentrated economic and educational opportunities, will need to own more vehicles and rely upon driving them farther distances, increasing their cost of living.
There are over 610,000 commuters in Travis County—the clear majority drive alone during their
 commute .Vehicle ownership costs Austin residents an estimated $12,481 a year, and costs slightly 
more in the outlying areas.
A regional typical household will spend 20 percent of their monthly income towards transportation, which is more than the 15 percent recommended form transportation.it is also nearly all the income for a person living under poverty, based on the poverty threshold of $12,486.
While public transit is a significantly more affordable mobility option, compared to car ownership, it is no longer an attractive mode of transportation when accessibility and reliability are considered. The Greenlight Institute describes transportation as accessible if it is physically available near people’s homes and easy to navigate, regardless of physical capabilities or cultural and linguistic differences.
